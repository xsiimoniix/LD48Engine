LD48Engine
==========

I'm going to use this engine in Ludum Dare 29. It is very basic and it goes with almost any 2D game. Feel free to use it as much as you like. You don't have to put me in the credits if you don't want to.

The engine can be exported as both an applet and an application which is very useful.

Work in the "Game1" class which is clean and simple to understand.
